Shortcut for basic VS Code settings and extensions the way we like them at Reuters Graphics.

## Quickstart

Run the package directly using `npx` from the root of your project to copy config settings to your project's `.vscode/` directory. Settings will be merged with any existing VS Code settings you have.

```console
npx @reuters-graphics/yaks-vscode
```

## Included config

- [extensions.json](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/yaks/blob/main/packages/yaks-vscode/configs/extensions.json)
- [settings.json](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/yaks/blob/main/packages/yaks-vscode/configs/settings.json)
